- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data):
##Rosalind 5
- Gemini
- Error explanation
- Syntax Error (Gemini replaced my previous code with its fix)
- Fixing the change to lowercase (needs to be case sensitive)
- Rosalind 5 sample data set
##Rosalind 18
- ChatGPT GPT5
- Please restate the following Rosalind problem in plain english, identify
inputs and outputs, and describe an algorithm to solve it, but do not give me code
yet. (+ the other steps in using GenAI as a tutor in the Mod 4 tuesday powerpoint)
- Given: A DNA string Text as well as integers k and d.
Return: All k-mers Pattern maximizing the sum Countd(Text, Pattern) + Countd(Text, Pattern) over all possible k-mers.
- Read through, removed comments and codes I thought did not add to what I was looking for. Removed extra print statements not asked for in Rosalind
- Rosalind 18 sample data set
